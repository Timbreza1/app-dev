# My Favorite movie is Pacific Rim 
## Which was the first movie if the franchise
**and the reason I love the first movie even thought there was a second movie was the following:**

> The Music just hits hard it accompnies the action and scene that it enhance thee fight to such greatness
> 
- Realistic the first movie of the pacific rim if you watch the fight scenes you can feel the heaviness of the units, it feels like a real Mech is made out of tons of metals and the melee combat when put to high definition speaker is really good
- 
3. CGI, yes it is CGI but it looks so real for an old movie unlike the second movie a bit of a let down but I still enjoyed it
`Awesome fight scene just really good...like REALLY good`
---
That is why I suggest watching Pacific Rim the first movie its great
